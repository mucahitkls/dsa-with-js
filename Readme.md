# Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript (dsaWithJS)

Welcome to `dsaWithJS`, a comprehensive repository dedicated to exploring and mastering data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. This repository is designed as a learning resource for me in understanding the intricacies of various data structures and the algorithms that operate on them, all through the lens of JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## What's Inside

### üìö Theory
Dive deep into the theoretical underpinnings of each data structure and algorithm. Understand their use cases, operational complexity (Big O notation), and their role in software development.

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
Explore JavaScript implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures like Linked Lists (both singly and doubly), Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more. Also, find a variety of algorithms with explanations and code examples.

### üéì Learning Resources
Access a collection of additional resources and exercises to further your understanding and practice your skills.

### ü§ù Contribution and Collaboration
This repository is open to contributions! Whether it's fixing a bug, enhancing the code, or improving documentation, your input is welcome.
